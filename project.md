# ✈️ Aviation Risk Analysis for Low-Risk Aircraft Investment

## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical aviation accident data to support a company entering the aviation industry. By examining accident frequency, severity, and trends from **1948 to 2022**, the project identifies aircraft with **lower operational risks**. Insights from the analysis are provided to the **Director of Aviation Division** to guide safe and cost-effective aircraft purchases.

## Project Goal
- Identify low-risk aircraft to guide purchasing decisions.
- Provide **three actionable business recommendations** based on historical accident trends.
- Present findings in a **non-technical presentation**, **Jupyter Notebook**, and **interactive Tableau dashboard**.

## Dataset
- **Source:** National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
- **Coverage:** 1948–2022, US and international waters
- **Key Features:**
  - Aircraft category
  - Accident location (latitude & longitude)
  - Weather conditions during accidents
  - Injury severity and accident outcomes

## Key Steps / Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Loading** – Load CSV dataset into pandas and inspect columns, data types, and missing values.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation** – Rename columns, handle missing values, remove duplicates, create derived metrics (`fatal_flag`).
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis** – Summarize accident data, visualize trends by aircraft type, year, location, and severity.
4. **Data Analysis & Aggregation** – Aggregate accidents by aircraft type, calculate risk indicators, identify low-risk models.
5. **Visualization & Insight Generation** – Produce bar charts, line graphs, and maps for both business and technical audiences.
6. **Business Recommendations** – Derive three actionable recommendations for safe aircraft purchase.
7. **Deliverables Preparation** – Prepare Notebook, non-technical presentation, Tableau dashboard, and GitHub repository.
8. **Submission & Review** – Ensure all files are complete, reproducible, and clearly documented.

## Deliverables
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Full analysis with Python code and Markdown explanations.

- **Non-Technical Presentation:** Summarized findings and recommendations for business stakeholders.
- **Interactive Tableau Dashboard:** Explore accident trends and aircraft risk metrics dynamically.
- **GitHub Repository:** Organized with README, cleaned datasets, notebooks, presentation, and `.gitignore`.

# Aviation Risk Analysis for Low-Risk Aircraft Investment

## Project Overview
The intent of this project is to analyze historical aviation accident data in order to understand accident patterns, assess potential future risks, and provide practical insights to support a company entering the aviation industry.  
The analysis focuses on identifying aircraft with **lower operational and safety risks** to guide informed purchasing decisions by the company’s Head of Aviation.

## Project Goals
- Analyze and evaluate historical aviation accident data  
- Identify aircraft types with the lowest operational risk  
- Support data-driven aircraft purchasing decisions  
- Provide **three actionable business recommendations** based on analysis results  

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle (Aviation Accident Data)  
- **Coverage:** 1948–2022  
- **Description:**  
  The dataset contains aviation accident records with key details such as:
  - Aircraft category and type  
  - Accident location (latitude and longitude)  
  - Weather conditions during the accident  
  - Injury severity and accident outcomes  

## Project Deliverables

### A) Non-Technical Presentation
**Audience:**  
- Director / Head of Aviation Division  

**Content Includes:**  
- Business problem and project overview  
- Summary of analytical approach  
- Key findings supported by clear visualizations  
- Three actionable business recommendations  
- Strategic next steps  

### B) Jupyter Notebook
The notebook is designed for a data science audience and documents the full analytical process.

**Required Sections:**  
1. Business Understanding  
2. Data Understanding  
3. Data Preparation  
4. Data Analysis  
5. Code Quality  
6. Summary and Conclusions  

**Notebook Workflow:**  
- Load the aviation accident dataset  
- Inspect columns, data types, and missing values  
- Clean data, handle missing values, and remove duplicates  
- Create derived metrics (e.g., fatal accident indicators)  
- Aggregate accident data by aircraft type and severity  
- Visualize trends using charts and graphs  
- Generate three actionable business recommendations  

### C) Interactive Tableau Dashboard
- Interactive visual exploration of accident trends  
- Filters by aircraft type, year, severity, and weather conditions  
- Designed to support quick, data-driven decision-making  

## Key Notes
- Use clear and meaningful variable names in pandas  
- Apply efficient and idiomatic pandas operations  
- Format all visualizations with appropriate titles, labels, and legends  
- Communicate insights clearly for both business and technical audiences  

## Conclusion
This project provides a structured, data-driven approach to evaluating aviation risk. By leveraging historical accident data, the analysis helps the company minimize safety and financial risks while entering the aviation industry and investing in aircraft with lower historical accident rates.
